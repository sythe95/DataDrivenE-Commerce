# **E-Commerce Customer Purchase & Product Prediction**  
## A Data-Driven Approach for Enhancing Customer Insights and Sales  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data to predict customer purchases and preferred products. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning models, it enables businesses to improve marketing strategies and customer retention. A Streamlit-based UI allows seamless interaction with predictive models.  

## **Key Highlights**  
### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Analyzed customer behavior, purchase trends, and revenue patterns.  
- Identified correlations between pricing, discounts, and sales.  
- Visualized sales distribution across categories and customer segments.  

### **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing**  
- Created features like next purchase probability and product preferences.  
- Cleaned, transformed, and merged multiple datasets for accurate modeling.  

### **Machine Learning Model**  
- Built a predictive model to classify customers likely to make a future purchase.  
- Developed another model to predict the next product a customer might buy.  
- Evaluated model performance using suitable metrics for accuracy and reliability.  
- Saved trained models as `.pkl` files for deployment.  

### **Interactive UI with Streamlit**  
- Implemented `app.py` to provide a user-friendly interface for predictions.  
- Users can input customer details to get real-time purchase and product recommendations.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)  
- Streamlit for UI Development  
- Data Handling (CSV, Excel)  

## **Conclusion**  
This project helps e-commerce businesses make data-driven decisions by predicting customer behavior, leading to improved sales strategies and targeted marketing campaigns.
